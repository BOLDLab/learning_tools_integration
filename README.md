#Description#
Provides template tags, grade write and grade read functions for integration into other systems using the Learning Tools Interoperabilityâ„¢ (LTI) protocol. LTI is used for cross domain access to external learning tools in the leading learning management systems (LMSs) and virtual learning environments (VLEs) used by educational institutions, such as Moodle, Blackboard Learn and Instructure Canvas. Once 'launched' from the LMS the user is automatically logged in using oAuth 1.0 and added to the Members table based on the LTI context sent from the LMS. Control panel access allows addition of an unlimited amount of LTI providers, each on different template url segments on the site. This module and extension use IMS Global's LTI Specification version 1.0.

Developed at the Centre for Teaching and Learning at the University of Newcastle (UoN), this tool is in constant development and used in on-line Blackboard courses.

It has had rudimentary testing in Moodle, further development is desired in this direction.

### Getting started ###

* Get a copy of [EE Core at Ellislabs](https://store.ellislab.com/#ee-core) (note this is limited to 3 back-end administrative and content development users, you will need to pay for the full version if you need more administrators).
* [Download the zip file of the latest release at devot:ee](https://devot-ee.com/add-ons/learning-tools-integration)
* Follow the instructions at the above link and the [installing add-ons section](https://docs.expressionengine.com/latest/cp/addons/index.html) of the EE documentation.

*The extension_hooks directory is in a [separate repository](https://bitbucket.org/sijpkes/ee3-lti-extension-hooks/overview) as this is where most of the LMS specific code is housed.  If you would like to contribute and build specific extensions to suit other LMSs, you are more than welcome!*

### Config File ###
The gradebook import and group functions require some URIs to Blackboards services.  These are set in the config.php file located here:
```
#!shell

ee_install_dir/system/user/config/config.php
```

Paste this code into the config file. You will need to modify the paths to match your institution.
```
#!php


/** LTI config items **/
/* This is for gradebook export */

// Blackboard's login page path.
$config['blackboard_auth_path'] = 'webapps/login/';

// Blackboard's getJSONData REST service query
$config['blackboard_gradebook_uri_query'] = '/webapps/gradebook/do/instructor/getJSONData?course_id=';
```

#EE Plugins#
