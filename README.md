### LTI Module for ExpressionEngine 3 ###

#Version 2.1#

* Provides template tags, grade write and grade read functions for integration into other systems using the Learning Tools Interoperabilityâ„¢ (LTI) protocol. LTI is used for cross domain access to external learning tools in the leading learning management systems (LMSs) and virtual learning environments (VLEs) used by educational institutions, such as Moodle, Blackboard Learn and Instructure Canvas. Once 'launched' from the LMS the user is automatically logged in using oAuth 1.0 and added to the Members table based on the LTI context sent from the LMS. Control panel access allows addition of an unlimited amount of LTI providers, each on different template url segments on the site. This module and extension use IMS Global's LTI Specification version 1.0.

### Getting started ###

* [Download the zip file of the latest release at devot:ee](https://devot-ee.com/add-ons/learning-tools-integration)
* Follow the instructions at the above link.
* The extension_hooks directory will soon be moved to a new repository as this is where most of the LMS specific code is housed.  This is where you can build specific extensions to suit your LMS.
